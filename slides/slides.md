``` 
And so it was that thee was a sign for the people of Sheba 
in their vicinity. There were two expansive gardens to the
right and their left (along every canal). 
 "eat of the bounty of your Lord and be thankful to Him! 
(Your) land is a fine one, and (your) Lord is a forgiving One."

However, they turned away (from their Lord), 
so We sent a flood against them that breached 
their dams and transformed their two  (luxurious) gardens into
gardens(of ruin), where only mustard trees, tamarisks and 
thorny bushes grew.

That was what they deserved, for they were utterly thankless
(for Our favors and did wrong). Would we ever bring such a 
payback against anyone else besides the thankless? 
- Saba (Shebe, 34:15-17) 
```


### Himyarites
* Yemeni king Yusuf Dhu Nawas and the fire
* Christian Abysinnia reconqueres Yemen 
* Abraha a general becomes governor

``` 
By the sky filled with constellations, by the Promised Day
and by the witness and all that it witnesses, (by these 
same tokens know that) the pit-diggers will be ruined,
(for they tried to destory the faithful) with a well-fed 
fire. They gathered around it and witnessed what they
were doing to the faithful.

They persecuted them for no other reason that 
they had faith in God. the Exalted and the Praiseworthy,
The One Whose dominion extedns over the heavens and the earth,
and God is a witness to everything.
- Al Buruj 85:1-8

#### Mahmud says no and Birds... little ones

```
I am the lord of camels, and the temple likewise has a 
Lord who will defend it. - Abd Al Muttalib
```

Abrahas army gets destroyed...

```
"Suddenly it was too late: the western sky grew black,
and a strange sound was heard; its volume increased as a great
wave of darkness swupt upon them from the direction of the sea,
and the air above their heads, as high as they could see,
was full of birds. Survivors said that they flew with a flight
like that of swifts, and each bird had three pebbles the size 
of dried peas, one in its beak and one between the claws of 
each foot. They swooped to and fro over the ranks, pelting
as they swooped, and the pebbles were so hard and launched 
with such velocity that they pierced even coats of mail"
```


### Quranic and Historical Reference

```
Haven't you seen how your Lord dealt with the army of the 
elephant? Didn't He foil their evil plans?
He let loose upon them a horde of fliers(carrying a plague),
which struck them down with stone-smacked(wounds), leaving
their ranks like barren fields- harvested and razed
- Al Feel
```

* When the surah is revealed, the story is not questioned establishing the validity and general acceptance of this remarkable event
